## How program works
E.g. 
./cpu_usage.py -M 20 -T 10
-M (memory check, if memory is higher than e.g. 20, it will beep)
-T (timer, 10 = 10 sec, its required).

Program settings:
- Beep if memory higher than 50MBs or higher than 1Gb

cpu_usage.rapport.txt is used to logg information:
- If app is running (beep once)
- PID, Name, Memory
- Was entered memory higher or lower than memory (higher = beep sound)
